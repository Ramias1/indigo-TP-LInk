<!-- If your plugin defines device types, you can define them here.

	 Devices must specify their type (via the type attribute):

		relay (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		dimmer (ON/OFF/DIM/BRIGHTEN/SET BRIGHTNESS/STATUS)
		speedcontrol (ON/OFF/SET SPEED LEVEL/SET SPEED INDEX/INCREASE/DECREASE/STATUS)
		sensor (ON/OFF/STATUS)
		thermostat
		sprinkler
		custom

	 The first six inherit states, actions and events from Indigo. You can
	 also specify your own custom actions and additional states, if needed.

	 The two Device examples below specify the relay and dimmer types.
	 
	 Devices must also specify a unique typeID - so, for instance, if you define
	 2 relay type devices then your plugin can distinguish between the two by
	 the typeID.

	<!-- I'm going to start with one relay device type for a Kasa SmartPlug.
	   Others can be added as I learn what they need to be.
